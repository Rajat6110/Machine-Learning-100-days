# 🚗 Car Crashes Dataset Analysis (Seaborn - sns)

This project uses the **Car Crashes dataset** from Seaborn to analyze road accident patterns across different US states.  
The goal is to understand how factors like speeding, alcohol consumption, and insurance costs relate to total accidents using data visualization and analysis.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

Each row represents a US state and contains the following features:

| Column Name       | Description |
|------------------|------------|
| `total`          | Total car crash incidents per billion miles |
| `speeding`       | Percentage of crashes involving speeding |
| `alcohol`        | Percentage of crashes involving alcohol |
| `not_distracted` | Percentage of drivers not distracted |
| `no_previous`    | Percentage of drivers with no previous accidents |
| `ins_premium`    | Average insurance premium |
| `ins_losses`     | Average insurance losses per insured driver |
| `abbrev`         | State abbreviation |
