# 🚀 100 Days of Machine Learning (#100DaysOfML)

This repository documents my **100 Days of ML** challenge, where I work daily on real-world datasets to learn, implement, and master Machine Learning concepts from scratch to advanced level.  
The aim is to build a strong, practical ML portfolio while maintaining consistency and public accountability.

I share my daily progress on Twitter to stay disciplined and visible to recruiters and the ML community.
